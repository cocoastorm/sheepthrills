 Sheep Thrills
 A simple engaging game that helps improves your cognitive abilities by training your memory and concentration. The main goal of our game is to count the number of times the sheep bounces against the walls. Each level will increase in difficulty, specifically there are distractions to deter you from keeping track of the sheeps bouncing.
 
/**
 * Code Structure
 */
As we are using Construct as our main game engine, there are layouts and event sheets. All of our events and the main backend of our game is found in the event sheets. There is a event sheet for each layout. The event sheet contains events that handles what happens for each layout. As such in our game:

Layouts:
- Menu Screen
- Level (1-5)
- Guessing Page
- Help
- Score Leaderboard

Once, development in Construct is done, the game will then be exported to a HTML5 game, which contains html and javascript files, along with the required resources for our game, such as the images.

/**
* Technologies Used
*/
At the beginning stage of development, we were coding with simple HTML5 and Javascript with a canvas element. However, during the second week we switched to using Construct a HTML5 game engine.

/**
* Issues and Problems Encountered
*/
- Using Git to collaborate and share code changes
- Switching to a game engine due to time constraints
- Setting up a working database for our score leaderboard
